# Amogus
Amogus is a very sus mod that adds AMOGUS to Minecraft.
The AMOGUS will sometimes spawn in any overworld biomes, exept in the deserts and badlands where they'll spawn ten times more.
Upon death, the AMOGUS will spawn sus nuggets. You can use them to craft sus ingots and the sus stuff.

NOTE: This mod is in very early developpement and we still have a lot of features to add, so stay tuned !
